References:
Use "res/maps/level1.map" and "res/maps/level2.map" as references when reading this.

Models:
The engine can only read .obj and .mtl files for models. The engine can only properly render triangles, so any other polygon types in a model file will have unintended results.
I recomend using Blender which can be downloaded from https://www.blender.org/

Command Description:
ex        - Describes the exit position and bounding box. There is only one exit.
g         - Describes the position of a new pickup. There may be as many pickups as desired.
gb        - Describes the bounding box of the pickups after it. The bounding box is specific to each pickup, so the location of this command is important.
gm        - Describes the model of every pickup. There is only one pickup model and it is used for every pickup.
gr        - Describes the rotation speed of every pickup. There is only one rotation speed and it is used for every pickup.
l         - Describes the position, ambient color, diffuse color, and attenuation of a new light. There is a maximum of eight lights.
m         - Describes the model of the map. There is only one map model. This model is considered a collidable object by the engine, so anything in the map model will have collision.
map_light - If this command is found then the lights will affect the map model. They don't by default.
ps        - Describes the starting position and rotation of the player.
